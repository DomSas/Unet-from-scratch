# Unet-from-scratch

The repository contains my implementation of [U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597).

The file structure follows the one in [Recurrent Visual Attention Model implementation](https://github.com/Mgryn/recurrent-visual-attention) by kevinzakka, asI think it's very well organized and I have worked with this code before.

I choose the U-net a it is a simple networ, that could be implemented fast. 

The work here is in it's raw state, the network has yet to be tested, and the code will have some descriptions, where necessary.

It would be great to additionally refactor the network for example to be able to work with different image input size.
